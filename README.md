# azure-doge

To run the application you need to first obtain your 

* Azure Storage Account name
* Azure Storage Account access key

These values shoud be place in the `application.propreties` file and in the `manifest.yml` file if you don't have the correct access key and account name you will get an error message form the application on startup.
